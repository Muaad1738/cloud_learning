# Cloud Computing

## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources, such as servers and databases over the internet. Instead of having a physical machine on your desk, you access software over the internet. It's like using apps and storing files online, but on a larger scale.

## On-premises vs. Cloud: How do we know if something is in the cloud?
**On-premises:** Everything is physically located at your own site. You take control of the hardware, software, and data yourself.

**Cloud:** These are stored and accessed over the internet. You don't need to have physical hardware, and the services are managed by a chosen cloud provider.

## The 4 deployment models of cloud:
### 1. Private Cloud:
- **What is it?** Resources are dedicated to one organisation. 
- **How it works:** Managed internally or by a third-party provider. 
### 2. Public Cloud:
- **What is it?** Services are offered over the internet to anyone who wants to use them.
- **How it works:** Resources are shared across multiple users on the same infrastructure.
### 3. Hybrid Cloud:
- **What is it?** Combines private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- **How it works:** Provides flexibility to move workloads between environments based on needs.
### 4. Multi-cloud:
- **What is it?** Uses services from multiple cloud providers.
- **How it works:** Organisations can choose the best services from different providers for specific tasks or regions.

## Types of cloud services:

### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- **What is it?** Provides virtualised computing resources over the internet.
- **Differences:** You manage applications, data, runtime, and middleware. The provider manages virtualisation, servers.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- **What is it?** PaaS offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run and manage applications without having to deal with the infrastructure.
- **Differences:** PaaS provides tools and services for building, testing, and deploying applications. Users focus on application development, while the provider manages the underlying infrastructure.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
- **What is it?** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
- **Differences:** SaaS applications are fully managed by the provider. Users access the software over the browser and do not worry about any maintenance.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing for Businesses

### Advantages:
- **Cost Savings:** Businesses can save money by paying only for the resources they use.
- **Scalability:** Cloud services can easily scale up or down based on demand.
- **Flexibility and Accessibility:** Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Cloud-based tools enable real-time collaboration.
- **Automatic Updates and Maintenance:** Cloud providers handle maintenance and updates.
- **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:** Cloud services offer backup solutions.

### Disadvantages:
- **Security Concerns:** Data security may be a concern in public cloud environments.
- **Internet Dependency:** Downtime or connectivity issues can affect access.
- **Limited Control and Customisation:** Businesses may have limited control over configurations.
- **Potential Compliance Issues:** Compliance challenges may arise.
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Dependency on specific cloud providers.
- **Performance Concerns:** Performance may vary depending on the workload.

##  Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and How It Relates to the Cloud

OpEx (Operational Expenditure) refers to ongoing expenses, while CapEx (Capital Expenditure) refers to one-time investments. 

Cloud computing aligns with OpEx as businesses pay for services on a subscription basis, avoiding large upfront investments in hardware.


## Is Migrating to the Cloud Always Cheaper?

Migrating to the cloud can lead to cost savings due to reduced hardware and maintenance expenses. However, it's not always cheaper for every business. Factors such as data transfer costs, ongoing subscription fees, and potential hidden costs can impact the overall cost of cloud migration.

Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of cloud migration depends on factors such as workload requirements, existing infrastructure, and the efficiency of cloud resource utilisation.

## Market Share Breakdown

Cloud computing market share is dominated by a few major players:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Holds the largest market share, offering a wide range of cloud services and solutions.
- **Microsoft Azure:** Second-largest cloud provider, known for its integration with Microsoft products and services.

## Which cloud provider do you think might be the best? Why?
![AWS](https://images.spiceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26162218/AWS.png)

AWS is highly regarded for its wide-ranging services, encompassing computing, storage, databases, machine learning, and analytics, tailored to meet diverse business demands.

Its global infrastructure ensures reliability and low latency, while its scalability allows seamless expansion as businesses evolve. Flexible pricing options like pay-as-you-go enable cost-effective solutions.

Additionally, AWS's secure security features and dedicated customer support add to its widespread adoption across various industries.

  
## What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?


When using the cloud, you typically pay for:
  - Compute resources (e.g., virtual machines, containers)
  - Storage usage (e.g., object storage, block storage)
  - Network traffic and data transfer
  - Additional services (e.g., databases)
  - Support plans and licensing fees


## What are the 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud?

- DevOps principles are based on four key pillars:
  - **Culture:** Fostering a culture of collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility across development and operations teams.
  - **Automation:** Streamlining and automating processes, including code deployment, testing. 
  - **Measurement:** Monitoring tools to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and drive continuous improvement.
  - **Sharing:** Encouraging knowledge sharing, documentation, and feedback loops to help facilitate learning and innovation.
